FROM SalesLT.Customer AS C 
	INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS H 
		ON C.CustomerID=H.CustomerID
	INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS D 
		ON H.SalesOrderID=D.SalesOrderID
	INNER JOIN SalesLT.Product AS P 
		ON D.ProductID=P.ProductID 
GROUP BY C.CompanyName,H.SalesOrderID,H.SubTotal 
ORDER BY H.SubTotal DESC

    SalesLT.CustomerAddress CA 
            INNER JOIN SalesLT.Address A
