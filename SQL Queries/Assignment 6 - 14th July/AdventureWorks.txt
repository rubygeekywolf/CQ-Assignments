    SELECT C.CompanyName,
	H.SalesOrderID,
	H.SubTotal,
	SUM(D.OrderQty*P.Weight) AS Total_Weight 
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS C 
	INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS H 
		ON C.CustomerID=H.CustomerID
	INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS D 
		ON H.SalesOrderID=D.SalesOrderID
	INNER JOIN SalesLT.Product AS P 
		ON D.ProductID=P.ProductID 
GROUP BY C.CompanyName,H.SalesOrderID,H.SubTotal 
ORDER BY H.SubTotal DESC


2. How many products in ProductCategory ‘Cranksets’ have been sold to an address in ‘London’?
    SELECT  COUNT(D.OrderQty)  
    FROM SalesLT.ProductCategory AS PC 
        INNER JOIN SalesLT.Product AS P		
            ON PC.ProductCategoryID=P.ProductCategoryID
        INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS D 
            ON P.ProductID=D.ProductID
        INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS H 
            ON D.SalesOrderID=H.SalesOrderID
        INNER JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS CA 
            ON H.CustomerID=CA.CustomerID
        INNER JOIN SalesLT.Address AS A 
            ON CA.AddressID=A.AddressID
    WHERE PC.Name='Cranksets' AND A.City='London'


3.For every customer with a ‘Main Office’ in Dallas show AddressLine1 of the ‘Main Office’ and AddressLine1 of the ‘Shipping’ address - if there is no shipping address leave it blank. Use one row per customer.
 -- Here Main Office and shipping is address type

    SELECT c.CustomerID,ma.AddressLine1 as MainAddress,ISNULL(sa.AddressLine1,'') as ShipAddress FROM SalesLT.Customer C
    INNER JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress MAIN
        ON C.CustomerID=MAIN.CustomerID
        AND MAIN.AddressType='Main Office'
    INNER JOIN SalesLT.Address MA
        ON MA.AddressID=MAIN.AddressID
        AND MA.City='Dallas'
    LEFT JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress SHIP
        ON C.CustomerID=SHIP.CustomerID

        FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail 
        GROUP BY(SalesOrderID)

   C) Sum of OrderQtyListPrice (Product table)
        SELECT D.SalesOrderID,SUM(D.OrderQty*P.ListPrice)AS Subtotal 
        FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS D 
	        INNER JOIN SalesLT.Product AS P 
                ON D.ProductID=P.ProductID 
        GROUP BY(D.SalesOrderID)

5.Show the best selling item by value.
    SELECT * from SalesLT.Product WHERE ProductID = 
    (SELECT TOP 1 P.ProductID
        FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS D 
        INNER JOIN SalesLT.Product AS P ON D.ProductID=P.ProductID 
        GROUP BY p.ProductID ORDER BY SUM((ListPrice-StandardCost)*OrderQty) DESC)

        SELECT TOP 1 A.City AS CITY FROM SalesLT.Address AS A 
		    INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS H 
			    ON A.AddressID=H.BillToAddressID OR A.AddressID=H.ShipToAddressID  
		GROUP BY A.City ORDER BY COUNT(H.SalesOrderID)DESC

    b) most profitable city 
    SELECT TOP 1 SA.City FROM SalesLT.Product SP 
        INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail OD 
            ON SP.ProductID=OD.ProductID
        INNER JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader OH 
            ON OD.SalesOrderID=OH.SalesOrderID
        INNER JOIN SalesLT.Address SA 
            ON OH.BillToAddressID=SA.AddressID OR OH.ShipToAddressID=SA.AddressID 
    WHERE SP.ProductID = 
        (SELECT TOP 1 P.ProductID
            FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS D 
            INNER JOIN SalesLT.Product AS P 
                ON D.ProductID=P.ProductID 
            GROUP BY p.ProductID 
            ORDER BY SUM((ListPrice-StandardCost)*OrderQty) 
            DESC) 
    GROUP BY SA.CITY 
    ORDER BY MAX(OD.OrderQty) DESC

    c) which hasn't placed any orders
    	SELECT A.City FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader H 
		    RIGHT JOIN SalesLT.Address A 
			    ON H.BillToAddressID=A.AddressID OR H.ShipToAddressID=A.AddressID 
        WHERE H.SalesOrderID IS NULL
