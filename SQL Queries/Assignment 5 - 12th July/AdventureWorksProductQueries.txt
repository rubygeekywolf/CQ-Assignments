1. What is the Name, ProductID and Weight for the item with Product Number 'RM-M823'

    SELECT Name,ProductID,Weight FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE ProductNumber='RM-M823'

 
2. List products with weight greater than 500. For those products, show the following information: Product ID, Name, ListPrice and calculated Gross Margin (difference between list price and standard cost)
 
    SELECT ProductID,Name,ListPrice,(ListPrice-StandardCost) AS Gross_Margin 
    FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE Weight>500


3. How many Products are there with the standard weight between 400 and 500
 
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE WEIGHT >400 AND WEIGHT<500


4. How many Yellow colored bikes are there (Bikes can be identified by the Product number starting with 'BK')
    
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SalesLT.Product WHERE ProductNumber LIKE 'BK%' AND Color='Yellow'


5. Find average, maximum and minimum list price for each Product line (exclude products where Product line is NULL), sort descending by Average Standard Cost.

    SELECT substring(productnumber,0,3)as Product_Line, AVG(ListPrice) AS Average,MAX(ListPrice) AS Maximum,MIN(ListPrice) AS Minimum 
    FROM SalesLT.Product GROUP BY(substring(productnumber,0,3)) ORDER BY AVG(StandardCost) DESC
